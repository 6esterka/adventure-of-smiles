# Project Title
 
Adventure of smiles

# Motivation

This project I have build for 2 purposes
1. I needed to make something interesting for course project
2. I wanted challenge myself in building the console game in C++

# Description

This is the game about the yellow smile that tryes to escape the maze where you may find enemy creatures that will bother you with staying in your way and making a damage. You have the ability of dealing damage too. After each step that you will make the all enemy creatures will move in totally random positions. In the mazes you can find different weapons that may increase the dealing damage points. Also you have to collect the coins and watch the highscore in the main menu. I have built three unique levels for this game

First level (Tutorial)
It is tutorial for adaptation you in the maze nothing special just reach the red wall block
Second level (Easter Egg)
It looks like first level but here i hided easter egg (secret level) where you can get extra-coins
(If you tired of looking for the easter egg, in the file Level1.h where i setted the maps look for '$' sign that i have substituted with the '#' that is actually the wall sign)
Third level (Fog)
With each step of your character you will dispel the fog and hidden creatures that were hided inside of that 

# Settings

W- moving up
S- moving down
A- moving left
D- moving right

# Build Status

The status of project is finished. Honestly, I just get enough knowledges from this project and my desire is to move on. I had a lot ideas about how I can update this game but I lost interest already and my mentor had told me that the stage where I get is pretty good. 
The main bug I have mentioned and didn't fixed is when you don't run the game in fullscreen mode the map start to crush
